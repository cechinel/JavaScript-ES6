# Exercise 1

#### Objective
Let's start with the most feared part by some, regular expressions. Basically, the goal is to extract parts of the command such as the table name and columns, storing them into variables that will be used in the next exercises.

#### Instructions:

Given the command: 

```sql
create table author (id number, name string, city string, state string, country string)
```

1. Extract the table name and store it in a variable named "tableName"
2. Extract the columns from the table and store them in a variable named "columns"
3. Manipulate the "columns" variable, removing the parentheses and separating each column, with its respective type, into a separate string.

#### Result

```javascript
tableName = "author"
columns = [ 'id number',' name string',' age number',' city string',' state string',' country string']
```

#### Tips

> Explore to the maximum the operations available in the String API as: String.prototype.match, String.prototype.replace, and String.prototype.split, along with regular expressions. The String.prototype.split operation returns an array, so you do not have to worry about creating or adding the columns in the array.
