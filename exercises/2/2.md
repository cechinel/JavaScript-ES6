# Exercise 2

#### Objective
It's time to start manipulating objects. Based on the previous exercise, use the table name and the columns to assemble an object structure to store both the table definition and the data.

#### Instructions

Given the command:

```sql
create table author (id number, name string, city string, state string, country string)
```

1. Create an object called "database"
2. Within the "database" object, create an object called "tables"
3. Within the "tables" object, create an object with the table name
4. Within the object created with the table name, create an object called "columns", where the keys are represented by the column name and the value by type
5. Within the object created with the table name, create an array called "data"
6. Change the "tables" property settings to {writable: false, configurable: false, enumerable: true}

#### result

```javascript
{
	"tables": {
		"author": {
			"columns": {
				"id": "number",
				"name": "string",
				"age": "number",
				"city": "string",
				"state": "string",
				"country": "string"
			},
			"data": []
		}
	}
}
```

#### Tips

> Scroll through the columns with for / of and use [] notation both to access the array elements and to create the properties in the objects.
