# Exercise 4

#### Objective
In this exercise, we will implement the "select" method in the first part. Then, in the second part, we will introduce the error handling, throwing an error if the table does not exist. Finally, we will migrate from object to constructor function. Remember to change the way this is used.

#### Instructions

Part 1

Given the command:

```sql
select name, age from author
```

1. Create a method named "select"
2. In the "select" method, return all records considering only the selected columns
3. Within the "execute" method, include the call to the "select"

Part 2

1. Handle errors by throwing an error if the table or column does not exist

Part 3

1. Switch from object to builder function

#### Scenario

```javascript
let database = new Database();
database.execute("create table author (id number, name string, age number, city string, state string, country string)");
database.execute("insert into author (id, name, age) values (1, Douglas Crockford, 62)");
database.execute("insert into author (id, name, age) values (2, Linus Torvalds, 47)");
database.execute("insert into author (id, name, age) values (3, Martin Fowler, 54)");
database.execute("select id, name, age from author");
```

#### Result

```javascript
[{
	"id": "1",
	"name": "Douglas Crockford",
	"age": "62"
}, {
	"id": "2",
	"name": "Linus Torvalds",
	"age": "47"
}, {
	"id": "3",
	"name": "Martin Fowler",
	"age": "54"
}]
```

#### Tips

> Traverse the columns with for / of and use the [] notation to both set properties on a return object and to fetch the values stored in the table. Remember that you can use Object.assign (obj, {key: value}) to define new properties in an object.
