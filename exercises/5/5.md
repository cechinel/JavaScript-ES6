# Exercise 5

#### Objective
Finally, it's time to migrate the code from the constructor function to the class.

#### Instructions

1. Convert the implementation of the constructor function into a class
2. Create a property named "name", which is the name of the "Database" and pass by parameter in the class constructor. If you are not informed, assign "New Database" by default
3. Change the behavior of the "execute" method to no longer need if
4. Create a class named "Table" with the columns and data properties, replacing this.tables [tableName] = {columns: {}, data: []}, with this.tables [tableName] = new Table ()

#### Scenario

```javascript
let database = new Database();
database.execute("create table author (id number, name string, age number, city string, state string, country string)");
database.execute("insert into author (id, name, age) values (1, Douglas Crockford, 62)");
database.execute("insert into author (id, name, age) values (2, Linus Torvalds, 47)");
database.execute("insert into author (id, name, age) values (3, Martin Fowler, 54)");
console.log(JSON.stringify(database.execute("select id, name, age from author")));
```

#### Result

```javascript
[{
	"id": "1",
	"name": "Douglas Crockford",
	"age": "62"
}, {
	"id": "2",
	"name": "Linus Torvalds",
	"age": "47"
}, {
	"id": "3",
	"name": "Martin Fowler",
	"age": "54"
}]
```
