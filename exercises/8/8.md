# Exercise 8

#### Objective
Let's approach the exercise of the real world. For this, in the "execute" method of class "Database", we will add a random response time, along with the return of a promise. With this, it is necessary to chain all calls to the "execute" method, otherwise it is possible that the "select" method is executed before the "insert" method.

#### Instructions

1. Enter a random timeout on the return of the "execute"
1. Return a promise in the "execute" method of class "Database"
2. Change the "execute" method calls to use "then" and "catch"

#### Tips

> In Node.js, use the setTimeout (fn, ms) function, passing the time in milliseconds in the second parameter.
